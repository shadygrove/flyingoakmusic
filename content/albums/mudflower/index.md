## Message From Martin

This music covers various recording projects over the past 10-12 years.  Many started out as simple musical ideas, often played on acoustic guitar, and then grew as additional instrumentation was added.

After realizing I had enough ideas to compile small collection of songs I decide to re-mix and master them throughout 2025.  Mud Flower is the end result of that effort.

### Dedication

I dedicate this album to all those people who encouraged me to keep at the music.  They may never realize just how much those simple words of encouragement have meant.  

In particular, I dedicate this album in memory of Diana Roberts.  You were always truly "for others" and just "got it" when you heard my music.  You are missed.

## Songs

### Conception

This came to me at a time in life when I was anticipating the birth of our little girl yet also contemplating the late-term loss of our first child.  For me, it brings me back to a time of mixed emotions of sorrow, fear, joy, excitement and anticipation.

### One Night

This came out of a bit of angst over not having a musical project in the works.  The idea was to see what I could create in one night.  By sticking to a simple two-chord progression I tried to set a mood.  By the end of the WEEKEND, I had something that I was satisified with.

### Mud Flower

This started as a little guitar riff that I played often.  Once I got it recorded, I wanted to see how I could create variations of the riff by adding percussion and other instruments.  I had fun with the percussion elements on this one.

### This'n That

Two different ideas came together on this one.  Originally, I called one This and the other That, but then the idea "This'n" something grew on me.  For me it means not to always be a casual observer of the world around you as if it wasn't meant or allowed for you to experience.  Instead, make "that" become "this".  The thing in your hand; not in someone else's.

## Happy Rain

This is just a little idea that reminded me of the pitter patter of rain... but with a happy bounce to it.  Rain doesn't always have to represent sadness.  Sometimes, rain is just the thing we need.  It refreshes, restores, replenishes, and  brings new life.

## Concept One

While not the first track on this album, it is one of the earliest ideas I first recorded years ago.  After some editing and mixing I was able to bring this one back to life.

## Luna

Honestly, this started out as a very simple experiment to test out some recording software that I was wanting to learn.  That software is called LUNA and there you go.  Eventually, all the songs on this album got re-edited, re-mixed, and mastered using LUNA by Universal Audio.
