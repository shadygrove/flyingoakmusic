Music creator, producer, and engineer and all around nice guy.
<!--more--> 
Martin enjoys producing music of all varieties, but specializes in acoustic and instrumental music.  He loves bluegrass music as well as old hymn melodies.  When he is creating his own music he sometimes dabbles in MIDI and virtual instruments to help fill out the sound.

For recording and production he uses LUNE software by Universal Audio.  He used to be a Pro Tools guy, but has recently enjoyed the workflow in LUNA, which enables a full vintage console via the API extenstion pack and plugins that reproduce tried-and-true professional analog gear by the likes of Neve, SSL, UA and others.

He also plays guitar and sings in a bluegrass band called the [Flyin' Oaks](https://www.facebook.com/flyinoaks).
